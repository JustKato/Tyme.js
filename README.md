## Why TymeJS?

TymeJS makes working with JavaScript date objects much easier, I've found myself<br>
multiple times in the situation where the client doesn't like their region's date format
and requests for custom formats, this consumed a lot of time implementing, so that's why
I have created this library, for:
 * Reliable Date formats
 * Reliable Time formats
 * TypeScript Support
